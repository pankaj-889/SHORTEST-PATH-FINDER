## Overview

This is a fun project on visualizing path finding algorithms i.e BFS, DFS, Dikstraâ€™s , A* algorithm. This app is entirely built in react and below is the how the interface looks like.. Green box is the starting node and Red box is the end node. You can see the various algorithms below to visualize. Here design of grid is done using tables and set first node and second node colors using CSS properties.

## Intro

Path finding algorithms plays a vital role in our daily life such as packets in computer networks , google maps uses a path finding algorthm to find the shortest path. So this project main idea is to visualize this path finding algorthms using react with the help of some css animations.

Let's check out the algorithm for better insights.

## Dijkstra

- Dijkstra's Algorithm lets us prioritize which paths to explore. Instead of exploring all possible paths equally, it favors lower cost paths.
- We can assign lower cost to encourage moving on roads while assigning high cost on highway to avoid them.
- It is the algorithm of choice for finding the shortest path paths with multiple destinations. Below is the demo
